## __A little about me__ ##

Hello, I am 29 years old. During this time, he graduated from university, served in the army, got a job and quit a year ago. After another year, I realized that I no longer wanted to move in the direction I had been going before. That's why I chose the path of a frontend developer. I am confident in my abilities and I know that everything will work out! It just can't be otherwise!
